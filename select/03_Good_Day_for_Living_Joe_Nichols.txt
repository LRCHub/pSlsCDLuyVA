Little place is a little bit understated
Yeah the O.J.'s always concentrated
It's a good day for livin'
Swear all my jeans got holes in the pocket
Yeah, the money falls out as soon as I start walkin'
Good thing the sunshine don't cost nothing
It's a good day for livin'

Livin' it up
Livin' it right
Livin' each day one day at a time
Ain't makin' no worry no bigger than it is, when it isn't
Yeah, I'm thinkin'
I wanna wake up and do it for the love
Glass half full, wanna fill the rest up
Gonna take a sweet sip of whatever life's fixin'
It's a good day
Good day for livin'

Got a cool tattoo of Rosie the Riveter
If there's a good time, good chance she's in it first
Any day that I get to kissin' her's
A good day for livin'
We sneak into a motel pool at 4 a.m.
And every time she smiles I say, "Amen"
One hell of a good staycation
It's a good day for livin'

Livin' it up
Livin' it right
Livin' each day one day at a time
Ain't makin' no worry no bigger than it is when it isn't
Yeah, I'm thinkin'
I wanna wake up and do it for the love
Glass half full, wanna fill the rest up
Gonna take a sweet sip of whatever life's fixin'
It's a good day
A good day for livin'

It's a wild ride but we all got a ticket
Yeah, it goes by quick, if you blink you'll miss it
Tomorrow's always short on specifics
But it's a good day for livin'

Livin' it up
Livin' it right
Livin' each day one day at a time
Ain't makin' no worry no bigger than it is when it isn't
Yeah, I'm thinkin'
I wanna wake up and do it for the love
Glass half full, wanna fill the rest up
Gonna take a sweet sip of whatever life's fixin'
It's a good day
A good day for livin'

Yeah, it's a good day
Good day for livin'
Oh, it's a good day for livin'
